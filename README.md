# LFR(Line Following Robot)
The workings of a line follower robot are pretty straight forward. These robots have the capability to detect a black/dark line on a lighter surface depending on the contrast. They estimate whether the line underneath them is shifting towards their left/right as they move over them.

## Component Required 
+ LFR chasis
+ Wheel
+ Caster Wheel
+ Microcontroller(Arduino Atmega 328P)
+ IR Strip
+ Jumper Wire
+ Motor Driver(L293D)
+ Battery(5V and 12V)
