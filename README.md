# LFR(Line Following Robot)
LFR is a automated guided vehicle whose workings is pretty straight forward. These robots have the capability to detect a black/dark line on a lighter surface depending on the contrast and vice versa. They estimate whether the line underneath them is shifting towards their left/right as they move over them  while advanced Line Follower Robots use invisible magnetic field as their paths.

## Component Required 
+ LFR robot Chassis(1)
+ Wheel(2)
+ Caster Wheel(1)
+ Microcontroller(Arduino Atmega 328P)(1)
+ IR Strip(1)
+ Jumper Wire(7-15)
+ Motor Driver(L293D)(2)
+ Battery(5V and 12V)(1 each)
+ Black Tape (Electrical Insulation Tape)(1)
